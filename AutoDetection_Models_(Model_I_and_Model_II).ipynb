We found Climate-FEVER dataset on HuggingFace which labels 1,535 real world climate change claims with \"SUPPORTS\" if there is evidence for the claims, \"REFUTES\" if evidence refutes the claims, and \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\" for claims that are ambiguous. In other words, claims those labeled \"REFUTES\" are climate skeptic claims with no base evidence. And we used the data from this dataset to test our models. You can find the datset here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/climate_fever\n",

In the two models below, we used the claims that are labeled as \"REFUTES\" since they are the claims with misinfo. Among the 1,535 claims, only about 300 are labeled as \"REFUTES\" which makes the dataset to be quite small.\n",
